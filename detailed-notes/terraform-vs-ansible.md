# Terraform vs. Ansible
---

## Ansible
- relatively poor orchestration performance
- much more mature with large community support
- difficult to manage configuration drift

## Terraform
- primarily an infrastructure provisioning tool
- relatively new compared to ansible, but still has good community support
- easier to manage configuration drift
