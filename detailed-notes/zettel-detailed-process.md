## Notes Types
- [[zettelkasten-notes]] taking process + personal knowledge management system
- 3 types of notes:
	- _basic_: temporary notes; used to create detailed notes
	- _detailed_: basic notes that have been combined + cleaned up
	- _permanent_: distilled detailed notes; 1 idea per note
		- Must be able to understand w/o context
-



## Connections Between Notes
- Once note hierarchy is completed, link the notes together based on some [[connections-between-notes]]
	- How does this idea fit into what I already know?
	- What does this idea mean for some already existing idea?
	- Does this add to/contradict/explain another idea I already have?
- Example
