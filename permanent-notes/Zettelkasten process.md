## Notes
- 3 major types of notes exist
	1. Basic notes are a temporary general overview of a **single idea**
	2. Detailed notes are a more detailed and expanded version of basic notes
	3. Permanent notes are a sort of self-test on what was accumulated in the [[Zettelkasten process]] of basic and detailed notes; ie. rewriting them in your own words
## Connections between notes
- [[Connections between notes]] are the next step after basic and detailed notes are created
	- Find some way to link basic and detailed notes together
	- use 2 square brackets to link a note in another note
